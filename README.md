This a ReactJS project with create-react-app where you can build your burger and prices are added for each ingredient.

Contains a Sign in , log in page and the burger builder and checkout page for the payment.

I used firebase as db, backend and deployment of this project.

React Redux for the store of the state of the app.

added some unit tests.

Todo List:
 - Fix the content for large screens to show the add ingredients menu closer to the burger (fix the bottom burger space)
 - Add more style to the buttons
 - Delete the page logo tab.
 - Fix the contact data menu with a flex box 2 columns on large page and 1 on mobile.
